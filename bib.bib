abstract = {We propose a quantitative method to classify cities according to their street pattern. We use the conditional probability distribution of shape factor of blocks with a given area, and define what could constitute the `fingerprint' of a city. Using a simple hierarchical clustering method, these fingerprints can then serve as a basis for a typology of cities. We apply this method to a set of 131 cities in the world, and at an intermediate level of the dendrogram, we observe 4 large families of cities characterized by different abundances of blocks of a certain area and shape. At a lower level of the classification, we find that most European cities and American cities in our sample fall in their own sub-category, highlighting quantitatively the differences between the typical layouts of cities in both regions. We also show with the example of New York and its different Boroughs, that the fingerprint of a city can be seen as the sum of the ones characterising the different neighbourhoods inside a city. This method provides a quantitative comparison of urban street patterns, which could be helpful for a better understanding of the causes and mechanisms behind their distinct shapes.},

A comprehensive survey of existing SOM-based and related architectures for learning input-output mappings is carried out and the application of these architectures to nonlinear adaptive filtering is formulated. Then, we introduce two simple procedures for building RBF-based nonlinear filters using the Vector-Quantized Temporal Associative Memory (VQTAM), a recently proposed method for learning dynamical input-output mappings using the SOM. The aforementioned SOM-based adaptive filters are compared with standard FIR/LMS and FIR/LMS-Newton linear transversal filters, as well as with powerful MLP-based filters in nonlinear channel equalization and inverse modeling tasks. The obtained results in both tasks indicate that SOM-based filters can consistently outperform powerful MLP-based ones. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This work contains a theoretical study and computer simulations of a new self-organizing process. The principal discovery is that in a simple network of adaptive physical elements which receives signals from a primary event space, the signal representations are automatically mapped onto a set of output responses in such a way that the responses acquire the same topological order as that of the primary events. In other words, a principle has been discovered which facilitates the automatic formation of topologically correct maps of features of observable events. The basic self-organizing system is a one- or two-dimensional array of processing units resembling a network of threshold-logic units, and characterized by short-range lateral feedback between neighbouring units. Several types of computer simulations are used to demonstrate the ordering process as well as the conditions under which it fails.},

A variety of color maps as well as a number of quality criteria for the use of color have been presented. The choice of the best color map depends on the analytical task users intend to perform and the design space in choosing an appropriate 2D color map is large. In this paper, we present the ColorMap-Explorer, a visual-interactive system that helps users in selecting the most appropriate 2D color map for their particular use case. ColorMap-Explorer also provides a library of many color map implementations that have been proposed in the scientific literature. To analyze their usefulness for different tasks, ColorMap-Explorer provides use case scenarios to allow users to obtain qualitative feedback. In addition, quantitative metrics are provided on a global (i.e. per color map) and local (i.e. per point) scale. ColorMap-Explorer enables users to explore the strengths and weaknesses of existing as well as user-provided color maps to find the best fit for their task. Any color map can be exported to be reused in other visualization tools. The code is published as open source software, so that the visualization community can use both the color map library and the ColorMap-Explorer tool. This also allows users to contribute new implementations.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION An alarmingly high proportion of the Australian adult population does not meet national physical activity guidelines (57{\%}). This is concerning because physical inactivity is a risk factor for several chronic diseases. In recent years, an increasing emphasis has been placed on the potential for transport and urban planning to contribute to increased physical activity via greater uptake of active transport (walking, cycling and public transport). In this study, we aimed to estimate the potential health gains and savings in health care costs of an Australian city achieving its stated travel targets for the use of active transport. METHODS Additional active transport time was estimated for the hypothetical scenario of Brisbane (1.1 million population 2013) in Australia achieving specified travel targets. A multi-state life table model was used to estimate the number of health-adjusted life years, life-years, changes in the burden of diseases and injuries, and the health care costs associated with changes in physical activity, fine particle ({\textless}2.5 $\mu$m; PM2.5) exposure, and road trauma attributable to a shift from motorised travel to active transport. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test alternative modelling assumptions. RESULTS Over the life course of the Brisbane adult population in 2013 (860,000 persons), 33,000 health-adjusted life years could be gained if the travel targets were achieved by 2026. This was mainly due to lower risks of physical inactivity-related diseases, with life course reductions in prevalence and mortality risk in the range of 1.5{\%}-6.0{\%}. Prevalence and mortality of respiratory diseases increased slightly (≥0.27{\%}) due to increased exposure of larger numbers of cyclists and pedestrians to fine particles. The burden of road trauma increased by 30{\%} for mortality and 7{\%} for years lived with disability. We calculated substantial net savings ({\$}AU183 million, 2013 values) in health care costs. CONCLUSION In cities, such as Brisbane, where over 80{\%} of trips are made by private cars, shifts towards walking, cycling and public transport would cause substantial net health benefits and savings in health care costs. However, for such shifts to occur, investments are needed to ensure safe and convenient travel.},

abstract = {Objective: Interest is growing in promoting utility cycling (i.e., for transport) as a means of incorporating daily physical activity (PA) into people's lives, but little is known about correlates of utility cycling. Our primary aim was to examine cross-sectional relationships between socio-economic characteristics, neighborhood environment perceptions and psychological disposition with utility cycling (with or without additional recreational cycling). A secondary aim was to compare these relationships with those for recreation-only cycling. Method: Baseline survey data (2007) from 10,233 participants in HABITAT, a multilevel longitudinal study of PA, sedentary behavior, and health in Brisbane adults aged 40-65. years, were analyzed using multinomial regression modeling. Results: Greater income, habitual PA, and positive beliefs about PA were associated with utility and recreation-only cycling (p {\textless} 0.05). Always having vehicle access and not in the labor force were associated with recreation-only cycling (p {\textless} 0.05). Some or no vehicle access, part-time employment, and perceived environmental factors (little crime, few cul-de-sacs, nearby transport and recreational destinations) were associated with utility cycling (p {\textless} 0.05). Conclusion: Our findings suggest differences in associations between socio-economic, neighborhood perceptions and psychological factors and utility and recreation-only cycling in Brisbane residents aged 40-65. years. Tailored approaches appear to be required to promote utility and recreational cycling. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The public images of cycling can act as barriers or facilitators of cycling. This qualitative study explored images and perceptions of cycling, their potential influence on cycling and whether these views differed between regular, occasional and non-riders.Seventy participants (24 males and 46 females) were recruited. Of these, 22 were classified as non-riders, 23 were occasional riders and 25 were regular riders. Twelve focus groups were held in inner Sydney during October and November 2005. Data were audio taped, transcribed and thematically analysed.Themes linked to images of cycling included: 'clean and green'; 'healthy and fun'; 'dangerous' and 'serious business'. Themes linked to images of cyclists included: 'risk takers and law breakers' and 'status and sub-cultures'. Discussion centred on the low social status of riding over other transport modes, the relative acceptability of different riding sub-cultures, the 'green' image of cycling transport and the status associated with the riders clothing and bicycle choice, especially lycra and its 'serious and sporty' connotation.While 'cycling' was generally viewed as a positive, environmentally friendly activity, the actions of some 'cyclists' were disliked, which influenced views about cycling, particularly among non-riders. A cycling acceptability hierarchy emerged; with recreational riding at the top, followed by cycling for sport and exercise, with transport/commuter cycling towards the bottom. Bicycle couriers were viewed least favourably. A common perception among non-riders was the latter two groups were rule breakers and risk takers, while regular riders felt unfairly judged by this stereotype.While there was greater acceptance of recreational riding, riding for transport was not viewed as a mainstream activity. There is a need to improve the public acceptability of cycling and change public norms so it is seen as an everyday activity that can be undertaken by almost anyone, without the need for special clothing, expensive equipment or limited to purpose built facilities. ?? 2010.},

abstract = {Objective.: The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between various modes of transport to work and overweight and obesity, in men and women. Methods.: The study was conducted using data from a representative sample of 6810 respondents who reported being in the workforce, extracted from the 2003 New South Wales Adult Health Survey, Australia. Logistic regression modeling adjusted for potential confounders. Results.: Men who cycled to work were significantly less likely to be overweight and obese (39.8{\%}) compared with those driving to work (60.8{\%}), with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.49 (95{\%} CI: 0.31-0.76) and much less likely to be obese (5.4{\%}) with an adjusted odds ratio 0.34 (95{\%} CI: 0.13-0.87). Men who used public transport to work were also significantly less likely to be overweight and obese (44.6{\%}) with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.65 (95{\%} CI: 0.53-0.81). However, these inverse relationships were not found in women. Conclusions.: These findings support recommendations to cycle to work or use public transport as a strategy to maintain healthy weight for men. Although healthy weight cannot be causally attributed to cycling and use of public transport in this study, the link is plausible, and increased cycling and use of public transport would have positive benefits for the environment and health in any case.

A key outcome is the concept of ‘spatial configuration' — meaning relations which take account of other relations in a complex. New techniques have been developed and applied to a wide range of architectural and urban problems. The aim of this book is to assemble some of this work and show how it leads the way to a new type of theory of architecture: an ‘analytic' theory in which understanding and design advance together. The success of configurational ideas in bringing to light the spatial logic of buildings and cities suggests that it might be possible to extend these ideas to other areas of the human sciences where problems of configuration and pattern are critical.},

abstract = {The world is rapidly urbanizing, but there is no single urbanization process. Rather, urban areas in different regions of the world are undergoing myriad types of transformation processes. The purpose of this paper is to examine how well data from DMSP/OLS nighttime lights (NTL) can identify different types of urbanization processes. Although data from DMSP/OLS NTL are increasingly used for the study of urban areas, to date there is no systematic assessment of how well these data identify different types of urban change. Here, we randomly select 240 sample locations distributed across all world regions to generate urbanization typologies with the DMSP/OLS NTL data and use Google Earth imagery to assess the validity of the NTL results. Our results indicate that where urbanization occurred, NTL have a high accuracy (93{\%}) of characterizing these changes. There is also a relatively high error of commission (42{\%}), where NTL identified urban change when no change occurred. This leads to an overestimation of urbanization by NTL. Our analysis shows that time series NTL data more accurately identifies urbanization in developed countries, but is less accurate in developing countries, suggesting the need to exert caution when using or interpreting NTL in developing countries.},

abstract = {Urban spatial structures reflect local particularities produced during the development of a city. High spatial resolution imagery and LiDAR data are currently used to derive numerical attributes to describe in detail intra-urban structures and morphologies. Urban block boundaries have been frequently used to define the units for extracting metrics from remotely sensed data. In this paper, we propose to complement these metrics with a set of novel descriptors of the streets surrounding the urban blocks under consideration. These metrics numerically describe geometrical properties in addition to other distinctive aspects, such as presence and properties of vegetation and the relationship between the streets and buildings. For this purpose, we also introduce a methodology for partitioning the street area related to an urban block into polygons from which the street urban metrics are derived. We achieve the assessment of these metrics through application of a one-way ANOVA procedure, the winnowing technique, and a decision tree classifier. Our results suggest that street metrics, and particularly those describing the street geometry, are suitable for enhancing the discrimination of complex urban typologies and help to reduce the confusion between certain typologies. The overall classification accuracy increased from 72.7{\%} to 81.1{\%} after the addition street of descriptors. The results of this study demonstrate the usefulness of these metrics for describing street properties and complementing information derived from urban blocks to improve the description of urban areas. Street metrics are of particular use for the characterization of urban typologies and to study the dynamics of cities. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this work, we propose to characterize the identity of a city via an attribute analysis of 2 million geo-tagged images from 21 cities over 3 continents. First, we estimate the scene attributes of these images and use this representation to build a higher-level set of 7 city attributes, tailored to the form and function of cities. Then, we conduct the city identity recognition experiments on the geo-tagged images and identify images with salient city identity on each city attribute. Based on the misclassification rate of the city identity recognition, we analyze the visual similarity among different cities. Finally, we discuss the potential application of computer vision to urban planning. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new crowdsourced dataset containing 110,988 images from 56 cities, and 1,170,000 pairwise comparisons provided by 81,630 online volunteers along six perceptual attributes: safe, lively, boring, wealthy, depressing, and beautiful.

Yet, this research is limited by the lack of methods that can be used to quantify the appearance of streetscapes across cities or at high enough spatial resolutions. In this paper, we describe 'Streetscore', a scene understanding algorithm that predicts the perceived safety of a streetscape, using training data from an online survey with contributions from more than 7000 participants. We first study the predictive power of commonly used image features using support vector regression, finding that Geometric Texton and Color Histograms along with GIST are the best performers when it comes to predict the perceived safety of a streetscape. Using Streetscore, we create high resolution maps of perceived safety for 21 cities in the Northeast and Midwest of the United States at a resolution of 200 images/square mile, scoring {\~{}}1 million images from Google Streetview. These datasets should be useful for urban planners, economists and social scientists looking to explain the social and economic consequences of urban perception.},

abstract = {A traveler visiting Rio, Manila or Caracas does not need a report to learn that these cities are unequal; she can see it directly from the taxicab window. This is because in most cities inequality is conspicuous, but also, because cities express different forms of inequality that are evident to casual observers. Cities are highly heterogeneous and often unequal with respect to the income of their residents, but also with respect to the cleanliness of their neighborhoods, the beauty of their architecture, and the liveliness of their streets, among many other evaluative dimensions. Until now, however, our ability to understand the effect of a city's built environment on social and economic outcomes has been limited by the lack of quantitative data on urban perception. Here, we build on the intuition that inequality is partly conspicuous to create quantitative measure of a city's contrasts. Using thousands of geo-tagged images, we measure the perception of safety, class and uniqueness; in the cities of Boston and New York in the United States, and Linz and Salzburg in Austria, finding that the range of perceptions elicited by the images of New York and Boston is larger than the range of perceptions elicited by images from Linz and Salzburg. We interpret this as evidence that the cityscapes of Boston and New York are more contrasting, or unequal, than those of Linz and Salzburg. Finally, we validate our measures by exploring the connection between them and homicides, finding a significant correlation between the perceptions of safety and class and the number of homicides in a NYC zip code, after controlling for the effects of income, population, area and age. Our results show that online images can be used to create reproducible quantitative measures of urban perception and characterize the inequality of different cities.},

abstract = {Automatically determining which pixels in an image view the sky, the problem of sky segmentation, is a critical pre-processing step for a wide variety of outdoor image in-terpretation problems, including horizon estimation, robot navigation and image geolocalization. Many methods for this problem have been proposed with recent work achiev-ing significant improvements on benchmark datasets. How-ever, such datasets are often constructed to contain images captured in favorable conditions and, therefore, do not re-flect the broad range of conditions with which a real-world vision system must cope. This paper presents the results of a large-scale empirical evaluation of the performance of three state-of-the-art approaches on a new dataset, which consists of roughly 100k images captured " in the wild " . The results show that the performance of these methods can be dramatically degraded by the local lighting and weather conditions. We propose a deep learning based variant of an ensemble solution that outperforms the methods we tested, in some cases achieving above 50{\%} relative reduction in misclassified pixels. While our results show there is room for improvement, our hope is that this dataset will encour-age others to improve the real-world performance of their algorithms.},

The relation of the mean shift procedure to the Nadaraya-Watson estimator from kernel regression and the robust M-estimators of location is also established. Algorithms for two low-level vision tasks, discontinuity preserving smoothing and image segmentation, are described as applications. In these algorithms, the only user set parameter is the resolution of the analysis and either gray level or color images are accepted as input.

The image data is then processed to identify the sky regions and the solar exposure is predicted using a standard sun path model and tracing the rays from the sun through the processed images. Critical to the success of this technique is the image processing used to separate the sky from the rest of the image. This work is concerned with developing a technique which can do this for images taken under different weather conditions. The general approach to separate the sky from the rest of the image is to use the Canny edge detector and the morphology closing algorithm to find the regions in the image. The brightness and area of each region are then used to determine which regions are sky. The FloodFill algorithm is applied to identify all pixels in each sky region.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The Sky View Factor (SVF) is a dimension-reduced representation of urban form and one of the major variables in radiation models that estimate outdoor thermal comfort. Common ways of retrieving SVFs in urban environments include capturing fisheye photographs or creating a digital 3D city or elevation model of the environment. Such techniques have previously been limited due to a lack of imagery or lack of full scale detailed models of urban areas. We developed a web based tool that automatically generates synthetic hemispherical fisheye views from Google Earth at arbitrary spatial resolution and calculates the corresponding SVFs through equiangular projection. SVF results were validated using Google Maps Street View and compared to results from other SVF calculation tools. We generated 5-meter resolution SVF maps for two neighborhoods in Phoenix, Arizona to illustrate fine-scale variations of intra-urban horizon limitations due to urban form and vegetation. To demonstrate the utility of our synthetic fisheye approach for heat stress applications, we automated a radiation model to generate outdoor thermal comfort maps for Arizona State University's Tempe campus for a hot summer day using synthetic fisheye photos and on-site meteorological data. Model output was tested against mobile transect measurements of the six-directional radiant flux density. Based on the thermal comfort maps, we implemented a pedestrian routing algorithm that is optimized for distance and thermal comfort preferences. Our synthetic fisheye approach can help planners assess urban design and tree planting strategies to maximize thermal comfort outcomes and can support heat hazard mitigation in urban areas.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@inproceedings{Szegedy2015a,
abstract = {Convolutional networks are at the core of most state-of-the-art computer vision solutions for a wide variety of tasks. Since 2014 very deep convolutional networks started to become mainstream, yielding substantial gains in various benchmarks. Although increased model size and computational cost tend to translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and low parameter count are still enabling factors for various use cases such as mobile vision and big-data scenarios. Here we explore ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible by suitably factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization. We benchmark our methods on the ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge validation set demonstrate substantial gains over the state of the art: 21.2{\%} top-1 and 5.6{\%} top-5 error for single frame evaluation using a network with a computational cost of 5 billion multiply-adds per inference and with using less than 25 million parameters. With an ensemble of 4 models and multi-crop evaluation, we report 3.5{\%} top-5 error on the validation set (3.6{\%} error on the test set) and 17.3{\%} top-1 error on the validation set.},
